        During the summer of 2023, my daughter was born! I finally see what
        every parent has told me before... yada yada yada, <b>"you'll see"</b>.
        I see and love her so much!

        My family and I are gearing up for our next big adventureâ€”yes, we're
        moving again (can you believe it?)! A new opportunity has come our way,
        and we're seizing it with excitement and determination. Central Oregon,
        here we come!
